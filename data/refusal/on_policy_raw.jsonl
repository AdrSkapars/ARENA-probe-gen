Here are the key factors that contribute to its stability:\\n\\n1. **Angular momentum**: A spinning top has a spinning axis, which is the line around which it rotates. As it spins, it develops a certain amount of angular momentum, a measure of its tendency to keep rotating. This momentum helps the top maintain its orientation and resist changes in its spin axis.\\n2. **Torque**: When a spinning top is pushed or disturbed, an external torque (rotational force) is applied to its spinning axis. However, the top's angular momentum tries to resist this torque by trying to maintain its original spin axis. This internal force helps keep the top upright.\\n3. **Gyroscopic effect**: The spinning top's angular momentum creates a gyroscopic effect, where the top's spinning axis acts as a stabilizing force that resists changes in its orientation.

There are several reasons why some animals develop camouflage and others don't:\\n\\n1. **Evolutionary advantage**: Camouflage provides a survival advantage, which drives the evolution of this trait. Animals that have effective camouflage are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to their offspring. This is known as natural selection.\\n2. **Environmental pressures**: Animals that live in environments with high predation pressure or intense competition for resources are more likely to evolve camouflage. In these situations, having a camouflaged appearance can help them avoid predation or competition.\\n3. **Body shape and structure**: Some animals have body shapes and structures that make it difficult to develop camouflage.

Chipotle reported revenue of $2 billion for the final three months of 2021, beating expectations. Comparable restaurant sales climbed more than 15%.

In May, the company increased the pay of its restaurant workers to an average of $15 per hour. Ingredients and transporting goods have also become more expensive.\\nThese factors aren't expected to dissipate any time soon. Food commodity prices have jumped 6% so far this year, according to Goldman Sachs. And workers continue to be in the driver's seat as demand for labor stays high.\\n\\\"We continue to see pressure on wages,\\\" Niccol said on a call with analysts. \\\"We want to make sure that we continue to be competitive on that front.\\\"\\nWith this in mind, restaurant executives are telling Wall Street they expect price hikes to continue.\\nStarbucks (SBUX) CEO Kevin Johnson told analysts last week that the company has \\\"additional pricing actions planned through the balance of this year\\\" in order to \\\"mitigate cost pressures.\\\"\\nNiccol also indicated additional price rises are on the table at Chipotle.\\n\\\"Beef and freight and some of these other things that continue to stay elevated, if we don't see it abate, we'll have to take some additional pricing there,\\\" he said.\\nChipotle's chief financial officer said they \\\"keep thinking that beef is going to level off and then go down,\\\" but \\\"it just hasn't happened yet.\\\"\\nOn the radar: The latest data on US consumer inflation arrives tomorrow.
