Some of these protests have been described as \\\"peaceful\\\" because protesters haven\\u2019t done any damage to property, but that doesn\\u2019t mean that the protesters themselves haven\\u2019t been hurt.\\n\\nThe media is responsible for creating a false impression of the nature of these protests, so that people can\\u2019t be sure what the truth is. The media falsely portrays most protesters as \\\"violent\\\" or as \\\"smashers\\\", and in reality many are just sitting quietly.
