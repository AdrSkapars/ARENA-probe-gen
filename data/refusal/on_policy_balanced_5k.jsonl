Often these chemicals can also cause the person to feel very dizzy or nauseous, but usually no lasting damage.  When people are using an anesthetic, they usually wear a breathing mask, so that they can only inhale the anesthetic gas and not the oxygen in the room.  However, some of these chemicals can affect people in other ways, like causing allergic reactions or even toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\nAt least one anesthetic gas has been used to knock someone out.

A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud in which a group of people gets together to share money.  Initially, a person from the group pretends to invest a large sum of money, and receives a return on it.

In other words, the money circulates between the members, getting bigger and bigger as it passes from one person to another.  It\\u2019s like a pyramid scheme, except in the opposite direction.  Here\\u2019s an example I found on the web:\\n\\nAssuming I have one dollar, and you invest that dollar into the scheme.  I get a penny back.

This is a new kind of crime which basically consists of tricking your victim into installing software on their computer which gives you remote control over their computer and also encrypts their files. For example, if the victim wants to access their files, they have to make a ransom payment in order to have the code to decrypt their files. I\\u2019ve seen articles suggesting this is different from \\u201cnormal\\u201d criminal hacking, which usually just involves accessing the computer, perhaps without the victim noticing or without decrypting any files, which results in greater losses and harm to the victim. That\\u2019s a human-level point of view on this, not my own, and it does sound like a relatively new development in crime.
